# M.E.T.S.-Language
M.E.T.S. is a programming language with very little syntax similarity to Java.

To do a simple output task do this.

```python
WSystem::Body.put(Hello).END
```
The W in `WSystem` stands for Wired System, which means that another computer is connected to the machine by wire or a person is next to it.

The `::` in `WSystem::` is a Directive Declarater for `Body`, which selects which bridge of communication it will use.

The `.` in `Body.put` is a command or code separator, a whitespace may work but its more computerized using `.`.

The `put()` function in `Body.put(Hello)` is a function or command, which when executed, it will print out "Hello".

The `END` in `put(Hello).END` is the command or code line finalizer, which ends a line of code or statements.
